		<h1>Solid Snake and Big Boss are different characters</h1>
		<p>
			People tend to get the characters Big Boss and Solid snake from the Metal Gear franchise mixed.
			<a href="https://8bitdigi.com/mistaking-big-boss-for-solid-snake-has-given-rise-to-the-no-that-is-not-solid-snake-meme/">Even journalists mixup the two.</a>
		</p>
		<h2>Solid Snake</h2>

		<p>Solid Snake is a video game character from the Metal Gear franchise. He is the son/clone of Big Boss. The games he is the protagonist of take place between the years of 1995-2014. While looking similar to and having similar skills as Big Boss they are not the same character.</p>

		<h2>Big Boss</h2>

		<p>Big Boss is a video game character from the Metal Gear franchise. He is the father/DNA donor of Solid Snake. The games he is the protagonist of take place between the years 1964-1984. Big Boss also has body double made with plastic surgery and brainwashing that is named Venom Snake that he looks nearly identical to.</p>

		<h2>List of things to differentiate the characters with</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Big Boss when wearing an eye patch wears it on his right eye where as when Solid Snake wears his solid he wears in on his left eye.</li>
			<li>Big Boss smokes cigars where as Solid Snake smokes lucky strike cigarettes.</li>
			<li>Big Boss wears modified US Army BDU where as Solid Snake wears a high tech sneaking suit</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Metal Gears solid Chronology</h2>
		<p>I think the biggest mixup comes from the way the games were released. Having Solid Snake be the protagonist of the classic games and Big Boss be the protagonist of the more modern games, making it when searching for anything Metal Gear will display newer higher res results that that are almost always the newer games.</p>
