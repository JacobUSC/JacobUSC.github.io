				<h2>About Yugioh Goat Format</h2>
				<p>This website lets you create and share decks for Yugioh Goat Format. To get started click the menu button in the top right corner and create an account.</p>
				<p>Yugioh Goat Format is essentially the Yugioh Official Trading Card Game frozen in time as it was in the summer of 2005. The rules of this format are mostly the same as the current rules of Yugioh if you want to read more you can read more about it here.</p>
				<p>Yugioh Goat Format is great for beginners who are new to Yugioh and are overwhelmed by the sheer number of mechanics and cards currently in the Official Trading Card Game. Goat format is also great for people who are fans of the original anime/manga series and want to play a format that more closely represent what was presented in the anime/manga series. Its also great for people that never got the play the game as it was in summer 2005.</p>
				<p>Yugioh Goat Format takes the game from around 13,000 cards to 1,688 cards. It also removes all of the extra deck monster types except for fusion monsters. It removes pendulum summons as well. The cards that are used in Goat Format are also much simpler easier to understand effects than the newer cards.</p>
